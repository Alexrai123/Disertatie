Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

System Architecture Overview:

1. Overview:
   - The system is composed of three main layers: 
     1. User Interface (UI)
     2. Application Logic (AI Engine + Functional Modules)
     3. Data Storage (Databases)
   - The architecture supports modularity, scalability, and secure interactions between components.

2. Components:

   a) User Interface:
      - Web-based or desktop interface for Admin and User roles.
      - Admin dashboard for monitoring alerts, reviewing AI decisions, and accessing chatbot.
      - User interface allows adding/removing folders/files and viewing system notifications relevant to their role.

   b) Application Logic:
      - Event Monitor: Observes file/folder activity in real-time.
      - AI Engine:
         - Processes events based on predefined rules and admin feedback.
         - Generates notifications and proposes actions.
         - Adapts rules dynamically over time.
      - Action Executor:
         - Performs automated actions based on AI decisions (e.g., block IPs, quarantine files).
         - Ensures sandbox containment for all critical operations.
      - Notification System:
         - Sends messages to Admin for decision-making.
         - Handles delayed actions if Admin does not respond in time.

   c) Data Storage:
      - PostgreSQL Database for:
         - User authentication and role management
         - System logs
         - Folder/file monitoring configurations
      - Optional separate database (or schema) for AI rules persistence.
      - Encryption applied to sensitive data fields (passwords, AI rules).

3. Data Flow:
   1. User adds folder/file → Event Monitor tracks changes.
   2. Event triggers → AI Engine evaluates against rules.
   3. AI Engine:
      - If Admin intervention required → Notification sent.
      - If automatic action allowed → Action Executor performs action.
   4. Logs and decisions stored in Database.
   5. Admin can interact with AI via Chatbot to query system or adjust rules.

4. Security Considerations:
   - Role-based access restricts features (Admin/User).
   - Sandbox ensures AI actions do not impact host system beyond allowed scope.
   - Secure communication channels between UI, AI Engine, and Database.

5. Deployment:
   - Application can run natively or within Docker containers.
   - Database configuration ensures persistence and adaptability for migrations.
