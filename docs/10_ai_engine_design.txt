Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

AI Engine Overview:

The AI Engine is the core intelligence of the application, responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to system events in a sandboxed environment.

1. Components:

   a) Event Listener:
      - Monitors file system activities (create, delete, modify)
      - Captures relevant metadata (timestamps, file paths, user actions)
      - Queues events for processing

   b) Rules Processor:
      - Evaluates events against predefined AI behaviour rules
      - Rules include severity levels, automatic actions, notifications
      - Supports dynamic adaptation based on Admin feedback
      - Stores adaptive rules in the database for persistence

   c) Decision Maker:
      - Determines appropriate actions based on severity and rules
      - Can take autonomous actions if Admin does not respond within defined time
      - Actions include file/folder quarantine, alert notifications, logging

   d) Notification System:
      - Sends alerts/messages to Admin
      - Can escalate based on severity
      - Integrates with Frontend for real-time updates

   e) Logging Module:
      - Records all events, actions, and AI decisions
      - Supports audit and research purposes
      - Logs stored securely in the database

   f) Feedback Processor:
      - Receives Admin feedback on AI decisions
      - Updates adaptive rules accordingly
      - Ensures AI learns over time without manual rule modification

2. Security & Access:

   - AI Engine only interacts with Admin via secured channels
   - Rules and logs are encrypted in the database
   - Role-based access ensures only Admin can query AI chatbot

3. Extensibility:

   - New rules can be added dynamically
   - Engine can be migrated to separate applications without losing behaviour history
   - Supports modular expansion (e.g., integrating machine learning modules in future)

4. Design Goals:

   - Autonomy with safe constraints
   - Persistent learning and adaptation
   - Secure and auditable operations
   - Decoupled architecture for modular deployment
