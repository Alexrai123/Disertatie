Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

Note: This normalized document mirrors 09_app_architecture.txt. See also: 09_app_architecture.txt

Application Architecture Overview:

1. Layers:

   a) Presentation Layer:
      - React-based frontend for Admin and User interaction
      - Admin dashboard with AI chatbot, logs, and monitoring overview
      - User interface for folder/file management
      - Authentication: login system with role-based access (Admin/User)
      - Secure communication via HTTPS

   b) Business Logic Layer:
      - AI Engine Module:
          - Monitors file system events
          - Evaluates severity of events
          - Determines actions based on AI Behaviour Rules
          - Sends notifications to Admin
      - Event Management Module:
          - Logs events, user actions, AI decisions
          - Supports real-time updates
      - Access Control Module:
          - Enforces Admin/User role permissions
          - Integrates with authentication module

   c) Data Layer:
      - PostgreSQL database for:
          - Users and authentication
          - AI behaviour rules and adaptive thresholds
          - Logs of events, decisions, and feedback
          - File/folder metadata (not file content)
      - ORM layer (SQLAlchemy or equivalent) for database operations
      - Secure password storage with hashing (e.g., bcrypt)

2. Modules:

   - Frontend Module (React)
   - Backend Module (FastAPI/Express)
   - AI Engine Module
   - Database Module (PostgreSQL)
   - Logging Module
   - Notification Module (Admin alerts)

3. Communication:

   - Frontend ↔ Backend: REST API or WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Backend ↔ AI Engine: internal API calls
   - Backend ↔ Database: ORM or direct SQL queries
   - AI Engine ↔ Admin: notifications via app messages

4. Security:

   - Role-based access control (Admin/User)
   - Encrypted passwords
   - Secure data storage for AI rules
   - Restricted access to AI chatbot for Admin only

5. Deployment:

   - Docker-ready architecture for isolated environment
   - Modular structure allows future expansion
   - AI Engine can be migrated to a separate app while maintaining rules in the database

6. Extensibility:

   - New monitoring rules can be added without code changes
   - Frontend can support new views for future user types
   - Backend modules are decoupled for easy maintenance
