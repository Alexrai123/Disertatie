Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

Functional Requirements:

1. User and Admin Roles:
   - Admin: Can configure system, access AI chatbot, manage rules, view logs, and approve or override automated actions.
   - User: Can add/remove monitored folders and files, view own activity logs.

2. System Monitoring:
   - Monitor specified folders and individual files for changes (create, modify, delete).
   - Log all file events with timestamps and user info.
   - Detect suspicious activities based on predefined rules.

3. AI Behavior:
   - AI adapts its decision-making based on admin feedback.
   - AI can autonomously execute actions if admin does not respond within a configurable timeout.
   - AI maintains persistent rules across application sessions and can migrate them to other applications if needed.

4. Notifications and Alerts:
   - Notify admin of critical events via system messages.
   - Escalate notifications if no response is received within defined time limits.
   - Different actions based on the severity of alerts.

5. Security:
   - Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and AI rules.
   - Restrict access to logs and AI outputs based on user roles.
   - Ensure sandboxed operations to prevent affecting the host system.

6. Database:
   - Support PostgreSQL for persistent storage of monitored data, AI rules, and configuration.
   - Provide automated database migrations if schema changes occur.

7. Chatbot (Admin Only):
   - Access system logs and summaries.
   - Respond to queries regarding system status or monitored events.
   - Limited to admin users only for security purposes.

8. File and Folder Management:
   - Add or remove folders/files from monitoring.
   - Define rules for monitoring on a per-folder or per-file basis.

9. Workflow Automation:
   - Support automated actions such as alert resolution, logging, or file backup.
   - Actions can be customized based on severity and admin approval.
