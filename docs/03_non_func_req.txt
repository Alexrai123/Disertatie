Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

Note: This normalized document supersedes 03_nonfunctional_requirements.txt. See also: 03_nonfunctional_requirements.txt

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Performance:
   - The system should detect file changes and process events in near real-time.
   - AI decision-making latency should not exceed predefined thresholds for critical events.

2. Scalability:
   - Support increasing numbers of monitored files and folders without significant degradation in performance.
   - Database and AI modules should handle growing datasets efficiently.

3. Reliability and Availability:
   - System must run continuously without crashes or unexpected shutdowns.
   - AI rules and configurations must persist across restarts.
   - Notifications should not be lost even if the admin is temporarily unavailable.

4. Security:
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive data (passwords, AI rules, logs).
   - Role-based access control to restrict features based on user roles (Admin/User).
   - Sandbox environment to prevent AI or monitoring actions from affecting the host system outside defined boundaries.

5. Maintainability:
   - Modular code structure to allow easy updates or feature additions.
   - Clear documentation for system architecture, AI behavior, and database design.
   - Logging and error reporting to facilitate debugging and maintenance.

6. Usability:
   - Simple and clear interface for adding/removing folders or files for monitoring.
   - Intuitive access to notifications and logs for the admin user.
   - Minimal configuration required for initial setup.

7. Portability:
   - The system should be deployable on multiple platforms (Windows/Linux) using Docker if desired.
   - PostgreSQL database support to allow consistent deployment across environments.

8. Adaptability:
   - AI behavior rules should adapt based on admin feedback.
   - Ability to migrate AI rules between different instances of the application.
   - System should accommodate future integration with other monitoring tools or services.
