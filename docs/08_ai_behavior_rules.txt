Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

AI Behaviour Rules:

1. Initialization:
   - AI loads default rule set from the database at startup.
   - Rules include severity thresholds, action templates, and notification priorities.

2. Event Evaluation:
   - For each detected file/folder event, AI evaluates:
       - Type of event: create, modify, delete
       - Criticality based on file type, location, and sensitivity
       - Context: time of day, frequency of similar events, past patterns
   - Generates a severity score (Low, Medium, High, Critical).

3. Action Determination:
   - Based on severity, AI decides on action:
       - Low: Log event only
       - Medium: Notify Admin
       - High: Notify Admin + suggest action
       - Critical: Notify Admin + automated action if no response

4. Feedback Adaptation:
   - Admin can provide feedback on AI decisions.
   - AI updates internal rule weights and thresholds accordingly.
   - Updated rules are persisted in the database for future sessions.

5. Escalation Rules:
   - If Admin does not respond within the specified time:
       - Minor alerts: AI waits
       - Major/Critical alerts: AI may execute predefined safe actions

6. Rule Persistence:
   - All AI rules, including adapted thresholds and decision weights, are stored in PostgreSQL.
   - Rules remain consistent across application restarts or migrations.

7. Security & Access Control:
   - AI only exposes chatbot and rule query functionality to Admins.
   - User role can only trigger monitoring events (add/remove folders/files), without accessing AI rules or logs.

8. Logging:
   - Every AI decision, adaptation, and automated action is logged.
   - Logs include timestamp, event details, severity, decision, and Admin feedback.

9. Learning Boundaries:
   - AI can adapt rules but cannot perform actions outside predefined safe operations.
   - Ensures AI cannot cause unintentional system or data damage.
