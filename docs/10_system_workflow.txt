Project Name: Secure AI Monitoring Sandbox

Note: This normalized document mirrors 06_system_workflow.txt. See also: 06_system_workflow.txt

System Workflow:

1. User Authentication:
   - User/Admin logs in through the login interface.
   - Credentials are verified against the database.
   - Session is created with assigned role (Admin/User).

2. File/Folder Registration:
   - User selects folders or individual files to monitor.
   - The system validates paths and registers them in the database.
   - AI Engine is notified of new monitoring targets.

3. File Monitoring:
   - File Monitoring Module continuously watches the selected directories/files.
   - Detected events (create, modify, delete) are sent to the AI Engine for analysis.

4. AI Analysis:
   - AI Engine evaluates events based on its current rule set.
   - Determines severity and recommended actions.
   - Stores event analysis and decision in the database.

5. Notifications & Alerts:
   - If an event is deemed critical, Admin is notified via the Notification Module.
   - If Admin does not respond within a predefined timeframe:
       - Minor alerts: system waits for Admin response.
       - Critical alerts: AI Engine may take automated action.

6. Admin Interaction:
   - Admin can view alerts, logs, and AI decisions.
   - Admin can provide feedback to adjust AI rules.
   - Admin can query system via Chatbot Module (logs, rules, summaries).

7. User Interaction:
   - Users can add/remove monitored folders and files.
   - Users have limited visibility: cannot access AI rules or Chatbot features.
   
8. Logging & Persistence:
   - All events, decisions, notifications, and user actions are logged.
   - Data is stored in PostgreSQL for persistence and audit purposes.

9. Rule Adaptation:
   - AI Engine adjusts its behavior based on Admin feedback.
   - Updated rules are saved in the database to maintain continuity across sessions.

10. Reporting:
   - Reports are generated on demand or scheduled.
   - Summaries include monitored events, AI decisions, Admin responses, and system status.
